This project is a collection of explorations and explanations of concepts related to artificial intelligence and machine learning.  The goal is to make tools that will help a non-technical audience, many of whom will be high school students, to understand some of the central issues in how AI systems work so they can think carefully about the implications of these technologies.

The code was written with code assistance tools such as github copilot and chatGPT, with careful checking of the output and trying to limit other dependencies as much as possible.

 * Medical diagnosis: pages exploring binary decision problems to explore the tradeoffs between different kinds of errors, to introduce vocabulary, and to understand the basic train / test / deploy cycle.
 * Loans: pages exploring somewhat more complex decision problems with more input variables
 * More topics to come later
